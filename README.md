## SvecoDocs

SvecoDocs is a documentation kit for the various [Svecosystem](https://github.com/svecosystem) projects. It's built and maintained for our specific needs, and is not intended to be a general purpose documentation tool. We won't be accepting feature requests for it, but we'll be accepting bug reports and PRs.
